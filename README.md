# Mesh Seq2Seq Transformer Jax Mesh Transformer JAX


An extension of Ben Wang's mesh transformer code (see: https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax) that is used to conduct experiments for seq2seq. Of particular interest is rotoBART (https://github.com/LouisCastricato/rotobart) and ERNIE 3.0 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02137) however to avoid limiting ourselves, this fork will be for all intents and purposes considered a general testbed for seq2seq experiments. 

# Goals

This repo will be updated over time with TODO and completed goals. Our current goal is to implement and train rotoBART 1.5b as well as Transformer-XL.
